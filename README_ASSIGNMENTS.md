## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Supabase DB
    ‚Üì
loadAssignments()
    ‚Üì
fetchAssignmentAnalytics() (for each assignment)
    ‚Üì
allAssignments array (state)
    ‚Üì
filterAssignments() (applies current filters)
    ‚Üì
createAssignmentCard() (for each filtered assignment)
    ‚Üì
Rendered HTML in calendarGrid
```

### State Management
```javascript
allAssignments = []        // Global assignment cache
assignmentFilters = {      // Current filter state
    subject: 'all',
    type: 'all',
    status: 'all',
    searchTerm: ''
}
```

### Supabase Queries

**Fetch Assignments:**
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('student_assignments')
    .select('*, submissions:submissions(count), grades:grades(score)')
    .eq('created_by', user.id)
    .order('due_date', { ascending: true });
```

**Update Deadline:**
```javascript
const { error } = await supabase
    .from('student_assignments')
    .update({ due_date: newDate })
    .eq('id', assignmentId);
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Single batch fetch for all assignments
- Client-side filtering (no re-query)
- Efficient array operations
- CSS transitions for smooth UX
- Lazy loading for modal content
