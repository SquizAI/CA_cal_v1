## Database Integration

### Expected Supabase Schema

#### student_assignments
```sql
CREATE TABLE student_assignments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('quiz', 'homework', 'test', 'project')),
    subject TEXT,
    due_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    assignment_id UUID,
    student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_student_assignments_created_by ON student_assignments(created_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_student_assignments_due_date ON student_assignments(due_date);
```

#### submissions
```sql
CREATE TABLE submissions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    student_assignment_id UUID REFERENCES student_assignments(id),
    status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('in-progress', 'submitted')),
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    content JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_student_assignment ON submissions(student_assignment_id);
```

#### grades
```sql
CREATE TABLE grades (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    submission_id UUID REFERENCES submissions(id),
    score INTEGER CHECK (score >= 0 AND score <= 100),
    feedback TEXT,
    graded_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    graded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_grades_submission ON grades(submission_id);
```

#### students
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    grade_level INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Required Supabase Policies

```sql
-- Allow teachers to read their own assignments
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can read own assignments"
ON student_assignments FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = created_by);

-- Allow teachers to update their own assignments
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can update own assignments"
ON student_assignments FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = created_by);

-- Allow teachers to read submissions for their assignments
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can read submissions"
ON submissions FOR SELECT
USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM student_assignments
        WHERE student_assignments.id = submissions.student_assignment_id
        AND student_assignments.created_by = auth.uid()
    )
);

-- Similar policies for grades and students...
```
