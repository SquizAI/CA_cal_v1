## Understanding Test Results

### âœ“ Green = PASSED
Test executed successfully, all assertions passed

### âœ— Red = FAILED
Test failed, check:
1. Screenshot in `test-results/[test-name]/`
2. Video in `test-results/[test-name]/video.webm`
3. Trace in `test-results/[test-name]/trace.zip`

### âš  Yellow = SKIPPED
Test skipped (usually because no test data available)

---

## Quick Manual Test (5 minutes)

If you prefer manual testing:

1. Open: `tests/MANUAL_GRADING_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Login to: https://ai-academy-centner-calendar.netlify.app
3. Follow checklist step-by-step
4. Check off completed items
5. Document any issues

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Won't Run

**Problem:** `npx: command not found`
**Solution:** Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

**Problem:** `playwright: command not found`
**Solution:** Run `npm install --save-dev @playwright/test`

**Problem:** Browser won't launch
**Solution:** Run `npx playwright install chromium`

### Tests Failing

**Problem:** Authentication errors
**Solution:** Check test credentials are correct in Supabase

**Problem:** Timeout errors
**Solution:** Increase timeout in `playwright.config.js`

**Problem:** Element not found
**Solution:** UI may have changed, update selectors in test file

### Database Issues

**Problem:** Database connection failed
**Solution:** Verify Supabase URL and anon key in environment

**Problem:** RLS policy errors
**Solution:** Check test user has proper permissions

      - run: npx playwright test tests/teacher-grading-workflow.spec.js
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: test-results/
```
