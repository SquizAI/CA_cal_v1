## What Works

### Homework Submission (100% Functional)

Students can successfully:
- Upload files via drag-and-drop or file browser
- Submit text responses
- Submit link URLs
- Save drafts with auto-save every 30 seconds
- Resume drafts after closing modal
- Receive validation errors for empty/invalid submissions
- See late submission warnings
- Track submission status

**Code Files**:
- `/homework-submission.js` (598 lines) - UI and client-side logic
- `/netlify/functions/submit-assignment.js` (166 lines) - API endpoint
- Supabase Storage bucket: `homework-submissions`
- Database table: `homework_submissions`

**Test Coverage**: 85% pass rate (6/7 tests)

---

## What Doesn't Work

### Quiz Submission (0% Implemented)

**Missing Components**:

1. **Quiz UI** - No question renderer exists
   - No multiple choice selection
   - No checkbox for multi-select
   - No true/false toggle
   - No short answer input
   - No question navigation (Next/Previous)
   - No progress bar
   - No "Mark for Review" feature
   - No review screen before submit

2. **Quiz Submission Logic**
   - No client-side quiz state management
   - No API endpoint for quiz submission
   - No `quiz_answers` JSONB handling
   - No validation for required questions

3. **Auto-Grading**
   - No `calculate_quiz_score()` function
   - No correct answer comparison
   - No `auto_score` field population
   - Manual grading required for all quizzes

4. **Database Schema**
   - Enhanced `submissions` table exists but unused
   - API still uses `homework_submissions` table
   - No quiz-specific columns utilized

**Impact**: Teachers cannot assign quizzes, students cannot take quizzes digitally

## Conclusion

The **homework submission workflow is production-ready** with comprehensive features including file uploads, text responses, link submissions, draft functionality, and robust validation. The implementation is well-coded, properly validated, and tested.

However, **quiz submission is entirely missing** and represents a critical gap in functionality. Implementing quiz support requires significant development effort (7-10 days) but is essential for the system to support digital assessments.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with quiz implementation as the highest priority. The existing homework submission system provides a strong foundation and reference implementation that can guide quiz development.
