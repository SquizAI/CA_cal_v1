## Issues Identified

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)
**None** - All critical functionality working

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Within 1 Week)

**ISSUE 5: No Automatic Overdue Status Updates**
- **Problem**: Assignments stay in 'assigned' status after due date
- **Impact**: Students don't see accurate overdue count
- **Solution**: Implement scheduled function to run hourly
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **File**: Create `/netlify/functions/scheduled-overdue-update.js`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY (Fix Within 1 Month)

**ISSUE 1: No Assignment Edit Feature**
- **Impact**: Teachers can't fix mistakes (wrong due date, wrong students)
- **Solution**: Add edit modal and API endpoint
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours

**ISSUE 2: No Assignment Delete Feature**
- **Impact**: Incorrect assignments clutter student dashboards
- **Solution**: Implement soft delete with confirmation
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours

### üí° LOW PRIORITY (Backlog)

**ISSUE 3: Quiz Not Editable in Assign Modal**
- **Impact**: Minor inconvenience - teacher must go back to enhancement panel
- **Solution**: Add inline quiz editor
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours

**ISSUE 4: No Student Selection Presets**
- **Enhancement**: Save time for frequently used groups
- **Solution**: Add "Recently Used Groups" dropdown
- **Effort**: 4-5 hours

**ISSUE 6: Form Validation Uses alert()**
- **Impact**: Minor UX issue
- **Solution**: Add inline error messages
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
