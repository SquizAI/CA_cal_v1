## Key Test Validations

### Grade Calculation Accuracy
```javascript
percentage = (points_earned / points_possible) * 100
letter_grade = {
  A: >= 90%,
  B: >= 80%,
  C: >= 70%,
  D: >= 60%,
  F: < 60%
}
```

### Weighted Course Grade
```javascript
course_grade = (homework_avg × 0.20) +
               (quizzes_avg × 0.30) +
               (tests_avg × 0.40) +
               (participation_avg × 0.10)
```

### Database Integrity
- Points earned ≤ Points possible
- Percentage auto-calculated (GENERATED column)
- Letter grade auto-assigned (GENERATED column)
- Grade history tracks all changes
- Course grade updates trigger automatically

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Latest Grade
```sql
SELECT
  g.*,
  a.title as assignment_title,
  cs.first_name || ' ' || cs.last_name as student_name
FROM grades g
JOIN assignments a ON a.id = g.assignment_id
JOIN centner_students cs ON cs.id = g.student_id
ORDER BY g.graded_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Verify Grade History
```sql
SELECT
  gh.*,
  t.first_name || ' ' || t.last_name as changed_by_name
FROM grade_history gh
JOIN teachers t ON t.id = gh.changed_by
ORDER BY gh.changed_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Course Grade
```sql
SELECT * FROM course_grades
WHERE student_id = '[student_id]'
AND subject_key = '7th_civics'
ORDER BY calculated_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Verify Category Weights
```sql
SELECT
  category_key,
  weight,
  description
FROM assignment_categories
ORDER BY weight DESC;

-- Should sum to 100%
SELECT SUM(weight) as total_weight
FROM assignment_categories;
```
