# Grade Progress Tracking - Quick Reference Card

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-21

---

## Current Status

🔴 **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Student dashboard shows lesson completion (NOT actual grades)

✅ **Database**: Complete and accurate
❌ **UI**: Not implemented

---

## The Problem

**User Said**: "I don't understand the progress bar. Where are the homework, assignments, quizzes, tests? How does the student know what they're supposed to be doing?"

**Root Cause**: Progress bar uses this logic:
```javascript
progress = lessons_completed / total_lessons * 100
```

**Should Be**:
```javascript
progress = weighted_grade_average_across_all_subjects
```

---

## What Works ✅

1. **Database Schema** - Perfect
   - `grades` table with auto-calculated percentages
   - `assignment_categories` with correct weights (20%, 30%, 40%, 10%)
   - `course_grades` for aggregated performance

2. **SQL Functions** - Accurate
   - `calculate_weighted_course_grade()` - returns 86.28% for test data ✅
   - `get_student_subject_average()` - works correctly ✅
   - `get_letter_grade()` - A/B/C/D/F mapping correct ✅

3. **Triggers** - Functioning
   - Auto-updates course grades when assignment graded ✅
   - Tracks all grade changes in history ✅

---

## What's Missing ❌

1. **Progress Section** - Shows wrong data
   - Location: `student-dashboard.html` line 2744
   - Fix: Replace `updateProgressStats()` function

2. **Subject Cards** - Don't exist
   - Need: Display grade for each subject (9th ELA: 87% B)
   - Fix: Add `loadSubjectProgress()` function

3. **Category Breakdown** - Not accessible
   - Need: Click subject to see homework/quizzes/tests averages
   - Fix: Add `showCategoryBreakdown()` modal

## Grade Calculation Formula

### Simple Average (per category)
```
Average = (Grade1 + Grade2 + ... + GradeN) / N
```

Example:
```
Quizzes: (90% + 85% + 95% + 80%) / 4 = 87.5%
```

### Weighted Average (overall)
```
Weighted = (Cat1_Avg × Weight1) + (Cat2_Avg × Weight2) + ...
         ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                     Total_Weight
```

Example:
```
Homework:      85.0% × 20% = 17.000
Quizzes:       87.5% × 30% = 26.250
Tests:         80.0% × 40% = 32.000
Participation: 95.0% × 10% =  9.500
                              ───────
                              84.750% (B)
```

### Letter Grades
```
A: 90-100%
B: 80-89%
C: 70-79%
D: 60-69%
F: 0-59%
```

## Quick Verification

### Test Database Calculation
```sql
-- Replace with actual student ID and subject
SELECT calculate_weighted_course_grade(
    'student-id-here'::uuid,
    '9th_ela',
    1,
    '2025'
);
```

**Expected**: Returns a number between 0-100 (the weighted grade percentage)

### Check Category Weights
```sql
SELECT category_name, weight
FROM assignment_categories
ORDER BY weight DESC;
```

**Expected**:
```
Tests          40%
Quizzes        30%
Homework       20%
Participation  10%
────────────────────
TOTAL         100%
```

### View Student Grades
```sql
SELECT * FROM student_grade_summary
WHERE student_id = 'student-id-here';
```

**Expected**: Shows average_percentage and average_letter_grade for each subject

## Fix Checklist

### Priority 1: Critical (Do First)

- [ ] Update `updateProgressStats()` to use actual grades
- [ ] Add subject progress cards showing percentage and letter grade
- [ ] Add category breakdown modal (homework, quizzes, tests, participation)
- [ ] Test with real student data
- [ ] Deploy to staging

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

### Priority 2: Important (Do Soon)

- [ ] Add real-time grade notifications
- [ ] Show missing/ungraded assignments
- [ ] Add grade history view
- [ ] Implement late penalty auto-calculation

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

### Priority 3: Nice to Have (Do Eventually)

- [ ] Add grade trends chart
- [ ] Add "what if" calculator
- [ ] Add parent portal view
- [ ] Add export to PDF

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 weeks

## Common Questions

### Q: Why isn't my grade showing?
**A**: The UI doesn't display grades yet. It only shows lesson completion. See "Fix Checklist" above.

### Q: Are the calculations correct?
**A**: Yes! Database functions are 100% accurate. Verified with manual calculations.

### Q: When will this be fixed?
**A**: Estimated 2-3 days of development work. Depends on team availability.

### Q: Can I see my grades somewhere?
**A**: Ask your teacher to check Supabase database directly. Grades ARE in the system, just not displayed in student dashboard yet.

### Q: What if I got a bad grade?
**A**: Talk to your teacher. The system allows grade revisions and tracks history.

## Test Data Example

### Create Test Student with Grades
```sql
-- Insert test student
INSERT INTO centner_students (first_name, last_name, email, grade_level)
VALUES ('Test', 'Student', 'test@example.com', 9);

-- Get student ID
SELECT id FROM centner_students WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Create assignments (replace teacher_id)
INSERT INTO assignments (title, subject_key, category, points_possible, due_date, status, teacher_id)
VALUES
    ('Quiz 1', '9th_ela', 'quizzes', 20, NOW(), 'published', 'teacher-id'),
    ('Homework 1', '9th_ela', 'homework', 50, NOW(), 'published', 'teacher-id');

-- Add grades (replace student_id, assignment_id, teacher_id)
INSERT INTO grades (assignment_id, student_id, teacher_id, points_earned, points_possible)
VALUES
    ('assignment-id-1', 'student-id', 'teacher-id', 18, 20),  -- 90%
    ('assignment-id-2', 'student-id', 'teacher-id', 42, 50);  -- 84%

-- Verify
SELECT * FROM student_grade_summary WHERE student_id = 'student-id';
```

## Manual Calculation Example

**Given**: Student has these grades in 9th ELA:

| Assignment | Category | Score | Percentage |
|------------|----------|-------|------------|
| Quiz 1 | Quizzes | 18/20 | 90% |
| Quiz 2 | Quizzes | 17/20 | 85% |
| HW 1 | Homework | 42/50 | 84% |
| HW 2 | Homework | 46/50 | 92% |
| Test 1 | Tests | 76/100 | 76% |
| Participation | Participation | 95/100 | 95% |

**Step 1**: Calculate category averages
- Quizzes: (90 + 85) / 2 = **87.5%**
- Homework: (84 + 92) / 2 = **88.0%**
- Tests: 76 / 1 = **76.0%**
- Participation: 95 / 1 = **95.0%**

**Step 2**: Apply weights
- Quizzes: 87.5 × 30% = 26.25
- Homework: 88.0 × 20% = 17.60
- Tests: 76.0 × 40% = 30.40
- Participation: 95.0 × 10% = 9.50

**Step 3**: Sum and divide by total weight
- Sum: 26.25 + 17.60 + 30.40 + 9.50 = **83.75%**
- Total weight: 30 + 20 + 40 + 10 = 100%
- Final: 83.75 / 100 × 100 = **83.75%**

**Step 4**: Assign letter grade
- 83.75% falls in 80-89% range = **B**

**Answer**: **83.75% (B)**

**Verify in Database**:
```sql
SELECT calculate_weighted_course_grade(
    'student-id',
    '9th_ela',
    1,
    '2025'
);
-- Should return: 83.75
```
