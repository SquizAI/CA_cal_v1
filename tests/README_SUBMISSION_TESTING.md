## Key Findings

### ✅ What Works

**Homework Submission System** is fully functional:
- Multiple file upload (drag-drop + browse)
- Text response submission
- Link URL submission
- File validation (type: PDF/DOC/DOCX/JPG/PNG, size: 10MB max, count: 5 max)
- Draft save with auto-save every 30 seconds
- Draft restore on modal reopen
- Late submission warnings
- API endpoint with validation
- Supabase Storage integration
- Database record creation

**Code Quality**: Well-structured, properly validated, good error handling

---

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**Quiz Submission** is completely missing:
- No quiz UI components
- No question renderer (multiple choice, true/false, etc.)
- No answer selection interface
- No quiz navigation (Next/Previous)
- No progress tracking
- No review screen
- No quiz submission endpoint
- No auto-grading logic
- No quiz_answers database integration

**Impact**: Teachers cannot assign digital quizzes, students must use paper

---

## Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Quiz Not Implemented (CRITICAL)
**Effort**: 7-10 days
**Files to Create**:
- `quiz-submission.js` (400-600 lines)
- API updates for quiz handling
- Auto-grading function

### Issue #2: Database Schema Not Used (MEDIUM)
**Effort**: 1-2 days
**Fix**: Migrate from `homework_submissions` to enhanced `submissions` table

### Issue #3: No Submission History (LOW)
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Enhancement**: Add student submission history view

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. Implement quiz submission UI and logic (7-10 days)
2. Update API to support quiz_answers
3. Add auto-grading calculation

### Short-Term (Next Sprint)
4. Migrate to enhanced database schema
5. Create submission history view
6. Enhance error handling

### Long-Term (Future)
7. Performance optimization for large files
8. Offline mode with submission queue
9. Accessibility improvements
10. Advanced quiz features (timed, randomized)
